# VeraGrid usage

To be able to use GSLV in the easiest form, the recomendation is to install it
along with `veragrid` in a moder python version, 
as the [installation section](installation.md) indicates.

You can check your GSLV version at the `help > about > Libraries` menu:

![libraries_at_help.png](figures%2Flibraries_at_help.png)

Naturally, you can select the GSLV engine at VeraGrid's general settings:

![veragrid_engine_selection.png](figures%2Fveragrid_engine_selection.png)

With the GSLV engine selected, the GSLV available simulations 
will be used instead of the native VeraGrid ones.

The rest is all the same. 
Check the [VeraGrid documenation](https://veragrid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to know more.

# File format support

It is to be noted that at the time, GSLV standalone only supports `.gridcal` and `veragrid` files.
However, coupled with VeraGrid as a plug-in library, it can run any file format that
VeraGrid VeraGrid can read.

Check the [VeraGrid documenation](https://veragrid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/md_source/file_operations.html) 
to know more.
